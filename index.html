      <h1>Speedfly with guide and mentor, Joey Innes</h1>
      <p>Hey, I'm Joey. I have been speedflying since 2014, and have accumulated many thousands of flights, and hundreds of hours speedflying.</p>
      <p>I've made most, if not all, of the mistakes that a pilot can make. I've reformed and continue to develop my flying style. I've experimented and applied learnings from other mountain sports. My paragliding experience helps me to assess and observe weather and thermic conditions. I have a Swiss paragliding license, and have done some SIV training. I am not yet a paragliding instructor.</p>
      
      <hr>

      <h1>Mentorship</h1>
      <p>I will mentor you in footlaunched speedflying, with a strong focus on maximising your safety. This is a comprehensive process that draws on all of my knowledge and experience. We take each day as it comes, and you are free to quit my mentorship at any time.</p>
      <p>Outside of this mentorship, I encourage you to message me with any questions. I will always endeavour to offer sound advice when possible.</p>
      <h2>1. No prior speedflying experience?</h2>
      <p>Pilots with speedflying experience can skip this stage.</p>
      <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
      <p>I ask that all pilots have at least some days of paragliding experience before speedflying with me.</p>
      <p>I suggest that the safest way to begin speedflying is by first paragliding. This is an old philosophy, and I believe it to hold true. Paragliding teaches you the fundamental techniques for footlaunching, active flying, and landing, all with minimal risk. Paragliding is very safe and easy to begin, and there are many schools/instructors that I can personally recommend. Please get in touch.</p>
      <p>Why do you think so many speedflyers lack knowledge of conditions, active piloting skills, and positive reflexes? To overlook paragliding is to disregard your safety, and the opportunity to learn fundamentals quickly and safely. You will progress safer, faster, and further as a paraglider. You can safely induce and resolve most scenarios that you may encounter while flying smaller gliders, while these issues can be deadly at higher wing-loads. You can also safely experience the full ranges of speed and angle-of-attack of a wing, which will allow you to fly smaller gliders optimally and safely. I wish that I understood this in 2014.</p>
      <h3>1.1. Kiting</h3>
      <p>Before your first flights, you must demonstrate an ability to handle your glider on the ground.</p>
      <h3>1.2. Theory: Piloting best practices</h3>
      <p>Before your first flights, I will cover some best practices that prevent accidents. This includes safe takeoff practices, prioritising safe & stable heading over any issue in flight, and conventional landing approach.</p>
      <h3>1.3. First flights</h3>
      <p>I bring beginner students only to flying sites with the least-demanding takeoffs and landings.</p>
      <h2>2. Speedflying safely</h2>
      <p>Note: if you skipped stage 1, I will cover 1.2. best practices during our first day of flying.</p>
      <p>I select flying sites that are appropriate for the ability and experience of all pilots within your group.</p>
      <h3>2.1. Weather assessment</h3>
      <p>I include you in my weather assessment process. As such, you will learn how I choose flying sites that are suitable for the given weather conditions. I will answer all of your questions. This will help you to remain safe and confident when flying alone in future.</p>
      <h3>2.2. Site introduction</h3>
      <p>I will help you to become familiar with a site if it is your first time flying there. We will first visit the landing to spot any hazards together, before going to the takeoff.</p>
      <h3>2.3. Improving takeoff and landing skills</h3>
      <p>I will ensure that your takeoff and landing abilities are sound and optimal. If anything can be improved, we will prioritise this until you are as safe as possible. This is absolutely crucial for a long and healthy flying career.</p>
      <h3>2.4. Observable weather</h3>
      <p>Throughout our flying day, I will teach you how to observe and assess weather developments. This will give you the tools to remain confident in conditions while flying, and to ensure that you never fly in dangerous conditions.</p>
      <h3>2.5. Further development</h3>
      <p>I will be with you at takeoff for each flight. I will often follow throughout your flight, recording video, if that is something that you would like.</p>
      <p>I will meet you where you're at, up to my own knowledge and ability. I'm open to your feedback, and I appreciate a challenge, as this is an opportunity for me to learn. I will answer any questions, provide feedback, and ensure that you play and progress within reasonable bounds. Safety is always our primary concern. I will never encourage you to try techniques that are far beyond your current ability.</p>
      <h3>2.6. Paragliding practices, applied to speedflying</h3>
      <p>XC paragliders know how to find lift, avoid sink, and how to maximise performance and stability in variable air. I'll help you to apply this to speedflying, giving you the confidence to fly safely and appropriately in a range of conditions.</p>
      <p>As always, safety is our primary concern. This is about ensuring that you have an ability to fly actively and performantly, to maximise the stability of your glider. I will also explain what to avoid doing, such as when to never lower your angle of attack, to further prevent risk of collapse.</p>
      <h2>Other details</h2>
      <p>Before any flying, I take details of your emergency contact so that I know who to notify in the unfortunate event of an accident.</p>
      <p>I have first aid training, and experience responding to emergencies outdoors.</p>
      <p>I don't teach in just one location, although I do favour certain areas. In the case of bad weather, we can often find flyable conditions within some hours of driving. I understand that you want to maximise the productivity during our time, while only flying in safe conditions.</p>
      <p>I primarily teach in the European Alps, but can venture further afield if my availability allows, and my transport cost is covered. Please get in touch to discuss.</p>
      <p>Mentorship can be one-on-one, or in a small group. Groups are cheaper for each individual pilot.</p>

      <h1>Guiding worldwide</h1>
      <p>I can help you to remain safe on your speedflying adventure. I have a sound ability to read weather models, judge conditions, and select flying areas that are suitable for all pilots within your group.</p>
      <p>I have a proven track record for discovering new flying areas, becoming familiar with local weather patterns, and making first flights safely.</p>
      <p>I have an extensive knowledge of the European Alps, and experience of other areas that are interesting for speedflying, such as Norway, Madeira, and Turkey.</p>
      <p>I began free-soloing and alpine climbing in 2012, climbed up to f8a in my teens, and am safe and competent in a high alpine environment up to AD+.</p>
